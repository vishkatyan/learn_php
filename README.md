# learn_php
PHP is a scripting server side language and widely used.

How to declare variables:
Using "$" symbol with name starts with either underscore or alphabet
e.g., $name = "Vishakha";
$_name = "vish';
$_a = 25;


***IMPORTANT***
PHP is loosely typed language

Rest of the things are as same as C, C++ or java like operators, expressions, switch case, statements, loops...

Currently learning about functions in PHP...

Recently I have made a mini project called as 'Calculator with dynamic content'.


***IMPORTANT***
***Interview Point Question***
Difference between == and ===:
* == refers to equal $x==$y --> Returns truw if $x is equal to $y.
* === refers to identical, $x===$y  --> Returns true if $x is equal to $y. and they are of same type.

String Functions:
1. strlen() --> Returns the length of the string.
2. str_word_count() --> Returns the word count of the string.
3. str_replace(search, replace, subject) --> Replaces a character/ word in a string, it is case-sensitive.
4. str_ireplace(search, replace, subject) -->  Replaces a character/ word in a string, it is case-insensitive.

To be continued...
