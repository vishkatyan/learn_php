PHP is a scripting server side language and widely used.

How to declare variables:
Using "$" symbol with name starts with either underscore or alphabet
e.g., $name = "Vishakha";
$_name = "vish';
$_a = 25;

PHP is loosely typed language

Rest of the things are as same as C, C++ or java like operators, expressions, switch case, statements, loops...
